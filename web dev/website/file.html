<p>In 2000, after a seven-month search, lead actor Daniel Radcliffe<br/>
 was discovered by producer David Heyman and writer Steve Kloves seated<br/>

 behind me was this boy with these big blue eyes. It was Dan Radcliffe.<br/>
 I remember my first impressions: He was curious and funny and so energetic.<br/>
 There was real generosity too, and sweetness.</p>
